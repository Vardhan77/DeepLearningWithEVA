 THE ENDGAME PROJECT  
Refer to the code shared in Assignment 7. 
Now use the same environment (car/map/sand/etc), and move that to TD3
Record your best attempt (it will be evaluated on how good your car's driving was in this video)
Upload Video on YouTube, upload your code to GitHub along with Google-Colab code for A7Car+TD3. 
Copy the Video and Code link to this assignment. 
Done!
 

EXPECTATION

You are indeed using TD3
You are NOT using SENSORS
You are using Conv Network (very very simple one) on your sand (so you can use MNIST type too) to get the sensory data. 
You have understood the problem and actually have tried to solve this problem.
